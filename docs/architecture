======== structure of the git repository "example.git": ========
pretend you have a working git repo with these files:

    readme
    index
    data.yaml
    docs/
        readme
        architecture
        todo
        license
        contrib
        hacking
        proposals/
            readme
            user_auth.txt

======== reserved words ========
no file or directory may use any of these as a name:

- new
- edit
- delete
- source
- history
- archive

no file/directory may contain the / character ('/')

no file/dir in the main/root directory may be called:
- login
- logout

======== rules for parsing a url ========

how to find the command in the url:
    - look for a reserved word farthest to the left
    - ignore everything to the right of that command (except variables)

======== urlconf resolution plan ========

 ^ make a directory if necessary
 ^ "new_dir/" makes a new file called "new_dir"
 ^ .. and "new_dir//" makes a new directory called "new_dir" (and lets you edit an index file for that directory)
 ^ respect the SHA
 ^ if an SHA is given, and the file was there, then edit that file - warn the user that a branch will be created
 ^ if an SHA is given, and the file was not there, make a new page and warn that the user will be making a branch
 ^ if an SHA is not given, and the file already exists, then you shouldn't be here anyway

 ^ edit the index page at that commit
 ^ note: if there is no index page for the main directory, then it should make an index page and branch from that commit of the repo
